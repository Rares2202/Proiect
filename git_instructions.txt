# Git Instructions for Committing and Pushing Changes

Since Git is not currently installed or not in the PATH on your system, you'll need to install Git first. Here are the steps to commit and push your changes once Git is installed:

## 1. Install Git

Download and install Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## 2. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell in the Project Directory

Navigate to: C:\Users\simon\OneDrive\Desktop\proiect\Proiect

## 3. Configure Git (if this is your first time using Git)

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 4. Check the Status of Your Repository

```
git status
```

This will show you the files that have been added or modified.

## 5. Stage the New Files

```
git add src/main/resources/proiect/sql/DBGENERATE.sql
git add src/main/resources/proiect/data/genuri.csv
git add README.md
```

## 6. Commit the Changes

```
git commit -m "Add database script, genre data, and README"
```

## 7. Check Remote Repository

```
git remote -v
```

This will show you the remote repositories configured for your project.

## 8. Push to Origin

If a remote repository is already configured:

```
git push origin main
```

(Replace 'main' with your branch name if different)

If no remote repository is configured, you'll need to add one:

```
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## Summary of Added Files
